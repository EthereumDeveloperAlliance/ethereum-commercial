Hi - my name is Alex Masmej and I'm your guide into the world of cryptocurrency.

I'm a robot, powered by artificial intelligence that can say stuff like "Wolf howls at really harry Howard".

Today I want to talk to you about this cool thing called cryptocurrency.

How cool you ask?

Well... You can be your own bank with Maker, stream booty with SpankChain or buy drugs with Ripple.

Just kidding. Don't use Ripple. It's bad for your health.

Cryptocurrency is an Internet technology built by friendly nerds and super smart finance bros.

The perfect recipe for a financial revolution. 

By now you're probably thinking "How can I join this financial revolution!" and the answer is "Do you even crypto bro?"

First you need to know scammers are everywhere. Pyramid schemes, money laundering, and plain'ol trickery is very common.

Unlike with today's online businesses, central banks and nation states you need to double check all your interactions.

Unfortunately, I'm almost out of words, but before I go I just wanted to let you know You should spent your entire life savings on cryptocurrency. You won't regret it ... Maybe.

I'm Alex Masmej and I approve of this message.
